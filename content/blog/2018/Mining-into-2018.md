Title: Mining into Twenty18
Date: 2018-03-14

######Happy pi Day

Early 2018 was a year in hardware for me. I upped my mining capabilities and that meant a lot of fun upgrades and moving stuff around.


The first picture is one of an upgrade on my passive itx build into a 1600 which isn’t passive anymore (the picture is right to left, sorry).

AM4 from AM1



The next three are shots of it as it evolved. Starting with a 2400G



Tossed in the 1060 from my other rig.



Had a Reference Vega 64 that I tried to fit it.



That built is currently offline but it added to the mining mix that year.

Next up is a Strix Vega 56 for my main machine. I would end up returning and exchanging it for the following picture…



The Nitro Vega 64. I also got a new case since the HAF XB was no longer fulfilling my needs and this PC wasn’t in the living room anymore, that was the ITX build. I mined all of 2018-19 winter with that Vega among others.



This was my Dell Precision T5500 Dual X5675 with 144GB of RAM. It became to loud so I sold it to start a Threadripper project.
