Music, Music, Music, Music,
Which music should I pick!

It was time for a choice. Do I leave the lab? I don't think I can explain what that weekend felt like. I even got a two weeks head up about the moment I was waiting for but it didn't really click. Even in our last meeting. I still tried to give it my all. I thought we were getting news finally, they made it sound like something was coming. I pitched an idea that in my head was similar to the Scratch cards at MIT. The Digital Toolbox has been modular in thought but not in documenation. With a move to Git, this could be be done!

My two closes friends there, Sasha and Dan, were warily distant after each of the respective departures. Now I understand that they both felt some responsibility for what happened. I don't agree with them.

So... What the fuck happened!? Seriously dude...

So maybe I went a little too "FREE(Ghost Town Pt2)". That's because "Kids See Ghost". In the aftermath I could still "Feel the Love". It confused me as to why I wasn't there anymore. I wondered if I made the wrong choice but I guess you always feel like that at a fork. When I felt my best, I knew I was "Reborn". I've been so before, I drew that tattoo on my left arm, I vectorized it. It was my first laser job in the Lab.

KIDS SEE GHOST wasn't alone.





I got an idea. I'll blog and I'll tuck this away for a while if I ever lose a job again until I get to the point like some of my peirs where its okay to be yourself. This past Tuesday they spoke on this subject. They talked about it in the form on tenurship. 

In the library too!
That's cool
I saw a post with some commentary on spaces like that in uni libs
Would you blog them yourself?

The point of real estate was the strongest one for me. The closing says more about outreach and finding ways to the niche user base.
With IRL2, do you know what happened to the resources in the Library at Lincoln Park campus?
