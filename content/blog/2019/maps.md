Summary: Makers in Chicago an idea that was inspired after attending CPL's Maker Summit in January of 2014. I've been at it again recently.

I won't write too much for now. I wanted to note down that this idea of mapping and connecting local businesses started around 2011. I found a reason to explore that idea in 2014. I had some troubles along the way, everything from personal to technical.

Most recently, I'm looking for good ways to spend my time, this seems like a good use of it for now.

The effort that I put it in comes in spurts but the ideas are germinating everyday. I'm enjoying it and I hope it'll be useful to somebody.
