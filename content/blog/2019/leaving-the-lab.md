On my birthday, February 4th, Roberto Pang emailed me to confirm my start date at CPL as a Cyber Navigator. This led to six most satisfying years of my working life.


On June 3rd, 2019, I decided to step down from the Maker Lab. The decision was over differences in what the job was monetarily worth, city bureaucracy brought in new brand new staff who were paid 39.5% more and immediately given more hours and benefits. I did not think this was fair and there was no easy solution to address this so I decided the best thing to do for the moment was to walk away and help in my own way. I still enjoy coming down there as often as I can make it. The team is amazing, please stop on by if you havenâ€™t been there. I am sure you will enjoy it!

Thank you, CPL.
