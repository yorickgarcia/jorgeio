Summary: I believe there is always tomorrow. I'll run out of tomorrows someday but there will still be tomorrows to go around. Today was pretty rough but I found out a friend turned in his tomorrows this past Friday. I'll see you all tomorrow.

Sometimes I feel as if we are just scrimmaging. A fallacy that things might be corrected down the line. Idealism playing out but not. Friday, Matthew killed himself.

Matt was Joey’s cousin. I’ve known Joey since my family moved into our Belmont-Craigin ranch style home. He is my oldest friend and his family is my family. I’ve known him almost as long as I’ve had my younger brother. I don’t need to knock or ring to come over, I can just open the door. Everyone has lived at Grammy’s house at some point. I rented one of the rooms upstairs for a few months in my early twenties. Joey was out of town with the Army, I needed a place and Grammy never turned us down.

When we first moved to the area, I met Joey as I rode my training bike and he rode his big wheel. Joey’s family came as a unit. It was him and his mom, Grammy and Grandpa Bill, Dell and Betsy, James was overseas but Monica was just welcoming Matt into the world. They moved out shortly after that but of course, they were always around. I have my core of friends I grew up with and we all brought people of our own with us often. Matt was that, a recurring guest in our mischievous adventures. His younger brother, Chris, was a little more reserved until his teens. I haven’t seen him yet but I could not fathom how he feels. I almost lost my brother last year after a car crash of his doing, but I didn’t. There’s a big difference.

I made my way back to that home Friday night. I arrived nearby to a weeping Joey. He didn’t want to go into the house. I held him in my arms as he struggled to look up. I took him to my house and our other friend, Alexsy, came over to join us. If there was any day to smoke it was today. We tried to reach out to Lemar but he was not answering. We kept ourselves open; we shared our love.

We met again late Saturday with Lemar joining us at Joey's. The day was rough on each of us carrying out the day in shock in our own ways. I napped, unable to do much else. Joey didn’t want to come to the city. Alexsy was at work but only in a physical way. Lemar, who worked with Matt, stayed home. We listened to music as we laughed about good times, acknowledging we all need to go back to that house soon.
