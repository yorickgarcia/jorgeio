Where would I begin this. Do I start at -1, 0, or now at 4?  

**i.** MTG  
**0** Summit + Bar  
**1** Initial Build w/ Connect Chicago, something to share  
**2** Smart Chicago kills and restore page into stagnation and eventually transits kill the hosting  
**3** Finding a new temporary home in Google Sites  
**4** 2019 reboot, finding a purpose, trying to avoid -1, the internal conflict: facing brexit

Lets start at four and work our way from there.

To get a few things out of the way. I left the CPL MakerLab on differences with the institution that I'll cover some other time if I feel it appropirate. I did not, however, have any hard feelings towards the MakerLab, and truth be told, I really wish I was still there. There is a lot of work I still would like to do there. For example, MakersinChicago. Before putting in my two weeks notice, I knew I still wanted to continue working with them at some capacity and by extension, this project. After all, it was my personal passion project. Thing there have a funny say of staying personal to each individual.

I started handing over all my keys, both digital and physical. I think they knew I wanted to continue it and at first I felt she was hesitant about letting me continue it. See, who MiC belong to was always up in the air. That's how it felt to me anyways. I was so happy that SmartChicago Collaborative agreed to host it for us. I still had to buy and maintain the domain, and I bought a single year incase they(CPL) would agree to pay for it. Renew time came around, I paid up again. When hosting issue occured. I ended moving it to AWS paying there, getting back on with SmartChicago, and then again it went down when they went through some major changes. Now it was time to figure out were to host, the old site was so messed up the lack of FTP access as people moved around over there that I didnt have a good way to get everything out so it was time to start over. I landed eventually on a sad little Google Site where it currently directs to. and that where we start trying to figure out what to do.

First move I made after leaving was to touch up the site. Sasha was updating the list and I decided to finally make a few more changes and add the Makerspace Map Tony (formerly from Mind+Hand) had put together. I thought for a moment that maybe I could stick to here and save some money of hosting elsewhere. I wasn't to familiar with other hosting options I would later discover, I had been away from webdev for so long that I lost touch of the latest tools.


I started bloggin on my own site a bit more. I had a lot on my mind after leaving CPL all together. So I took to my wordpress. By this time I had grown pretty tired of both AWS and Wordpress. I started looking around. What I found were these great Static Site Generators. 

Going back a few more months mentally, I starting thinking about the conversations I was having around fields that led me here. Let me list these topics:
* Tony and Andrew had some ideas on how to use the site as a resource for educators, still waiting to hear on this some more.
* Sasha mentioned moving the lab's resources in GitHub, possibly from converesations during Farsheeds interview.
* In expressing my frustation with Wordpress, Bill mentioned I should start using Markdown.
* I had seen enough of Heroku to know that it was a useful resource for hosting apps, that lead me to Netlify.

With that and my new found unemployement, I decided to restart my own site. I began to research new options and found staticgen.com as a resource to discover these cool tools. After having hosting some great Learning Circle around Python, I thought it would be best to use one that used it. I landed on Pelican, as it seemed to have the largest community adoption thus probably support.

I built and built but lets not get into that at the moment, back to Makers in Chicago.

So lets get away from Google Site yeah? Where do we begin a new Makers in Chicago. Well we can try out a new SSG, Pelican was fun. Can deeper into it? Turn out the answer would be no, not now. I deployed a Gatsby site using Netlify's single click. It was too easy... So I deleted it and built it in the terminal. It was just as easy, I was just intimidated. So I went back in and built, yet again, one from a theme. The starter site was called WakandaJS by a group in Canada, a little offputting and insensitive to be honest but I liked the layout. Eitherway, I found a theme to work backwards from. I like reverse engineering but this was a pain in my flat ass. So with it there, I began to work on some graphical work, rewording a few things to get a site that looked like what I might want to put out. I like it through and through but was not satisfied. I would have to dig so far back and rename all the constructs that were here, again– PITA. That's not to say I couldn't have figure it out but what I started thinking about was the content. I could make this site look nice that wasn't too hard. But what good is all the flashiness if the content isn't there or any good. At that point I realized that I was approaching this the wrong way.
