I was sick. Still, thirty miles at almost four hours of riding. The sinus headache came back every time I had to start again. There was one point I couldn't even look forward from the pain. I kept going, I had the bike, not many other options.

I biked to the library to start. I enjoy the route there, and who knows who might be in there today. I stayed for the class and practiced my sewing. I forgot that I was suppose to make a monster, it was the technique I was there for. I often focused on the skills and made things to test them.

Before riding out, I needed Hero. It really sucks they closed the Roscoe Village location, it was the one closets to me, I could actually make it there regularly with Julian's school being not to far from it. 

I rode North, the lakefront would be great right? Well, kind of. I found large sheets of ice covering the path. It made it difficult to continue riding regularly. I jumped off my bike and walked for a few segments. The lake looked beautiful.

I made it Evanston. I delivered the computer. I ate my Greek Burger meal with a Hazy IPA.

The ride back was pleasantly new. Many routes unfamiliar to me, with bites of regular routes. I found my self on an unlit path. I was mesmerized by the darkness on my bike and then a song came on over my headphones that I've been obsessed with this past week.

At this point I stopped, I laid on the floor, laid the bike over me. Listened and enjoyed the moment.

Listened once more, got up and went to home to meet a friend at the pub.

The next day I sleep just about all day.
