🎵 … couldn’t post a thing…

What if posts could be edited!

When I first posted this, admittedly it was just a few minutes ago, I was in the middle of writing a longer post. To refresh and escape the tunnel vision trip, I wanted to do a quick image post. What I noticed right away was that the IFTTT widget I was using did a poor job. I didn’t add the image and it doesn’t really appear as a blog post of sorts. As such, I will be in search of a better solution, maybe I build one using python…? I saw a guide somewhere that I’ll have to dig up.

I face the challenge of deciding what to share. When in situations like this, I reflect back on the people that I’ve met or have observed. Austin Kleon has been on my mind lately, specifically two ideas he shared at the Scratch Conference. Those are, “Creativity is Subtraction” and just now, [The So What? Test](https://austinkleon.com/2015/03/04/the-so-what-test/).

I have so many drafts here. Recently, I pushed a few out from years ago. For what ever reason I kept them there. Perhaps that will be my approach. So here’s an image post, with as short of a write up as you can expect at this hour.

This one get published right away.- (circa 07/21/19 2am)
