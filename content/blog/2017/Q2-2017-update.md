Spring of 2017 is an exciting time for me. I am back at HWLC’s YOUmedia but this time as a Lead Mentor with a focus on Make Culture and Computer Science. That means I’ll be working to facilitate CS learning in YOUmedia as well as introducing and maintaining maker related equipment. Alongside that, I will continue working at the Maker Lab as the senior Maker Specialist II. I am glad to be back in one building and looking forward to the programming that I will be doing with both departments.

I have added some content on my Projects page. It includes several but not all Finch documentation that I have created. I am often asked to share resources with teachers and other people I come across when discussing the Finch. That usually involves me sending an email and attaching these files. I have decided to post these files online so they can be accessed even when I forget to send an email. I have uploaded them to Google Drive and collected the links here.

I am also adding my computer builds to my Projects page. I thought of this after putting some upgrades into my PC. I really like what AMD is doing and the Ryzen 7 1700 now powers my main build and I absolutely love it. I now have no Intel desktop builds which makes me a bit sad but the Ryzen build has taken over my two previous ones. I also have a new laptop after my Y510p started failing on the GPU side of things. I really put that computer through its paces and it served me very well. Since the beginning of the year, I have sold my 2600K, gave away my 4700MQ, and set my FX-8320 aside.

This Spring will be exciting for me as I grow into the position I have taken. I already know most of the teens that I am working with since I used to be at this YOUmedia. The difference is now I can provide the help and do the activities they wanted me to take part in. The Maker Lab also continues to grow as we incorporate Fusion 360. Workshops with Fusion will begin soon and I know it will empower the staff and our patrons.
