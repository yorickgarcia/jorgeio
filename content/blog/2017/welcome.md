If you’ve stumbled upon this site (at least in 2017), it is probably because you received an email from me and you’re wondering about the domain. My name is Jorge Garcia of Chicago, I’m a technologist, maker, cyclist, and father. I recently decide to leave my position with the City of Chicago – Chicago Public Library as a Page. Since joining as a grant funded Cyber Navigator in February 2013, I have used my @chipublib email for formal work related communications. I will be departing my Page position by the end of January 2017 and returning to more grant funded work with CPL. As of February 2017, I will be the Maker Specialist II in CPL's Maker Lab and a YOUmedia Specialist at Harold Washington Library Center. I would rather not use my personal email for work so here I am with a new email address. I look forward to returning as a city staff member with CPL but first I must finish up my education.
