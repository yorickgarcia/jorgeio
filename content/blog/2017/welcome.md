Title:Welcome to my site.
Date: 2017-01-17

If you’ve stumbled upon this site, it is probably because you received an email from me and you’re wondering about the domain. My name is Jorge Garcia of Chicago, I’m a technologist, maker, cyclist, and father. I recently decide to leave my position with the City of Chicago – Chicago Public Library as a Page. Since joining as a grant funded Cyber Navigator in February 2013, I have used my @chipublib email for formal work related communications. I will be departing my Page position by the end of January 2017 and returning to more grant funded work with CPL. As of February 2017, I will be a Maker Specialist II and YOUmedia Specialist. I would rather not use my personal email for work so here I am with a new email address. I look forward to returning as a city staff member with CPL but first I must finish up my education.
