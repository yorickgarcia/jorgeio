          <p>This will be in the first person, as I am the one writing it.
I was born in Cook County Hospital in Illinois as a second child to two immigrant farm folks who made their best attempts at escaping their situation and left it all behind them. As I understand it, we moved back to Mexico after my birth for two years before returning to Chicago for good.</p>
<p>As I can remember, we lived doors down from the Logan Square McDonalds. In 93 we moved to our new house in the Belmont-Craigin neighborhood and grew up with three other guys who have made up what I call my family. They are/were Joseph Andrew Chesser, Lemar Woods, and Alexsy Martinez. I liken them to brothers so much that I cannot get away from them even if I tried and will never introduce them as my friend in real life.</p>
<p>I went to grammar school outside of my district, we asked a family friend if we could use their address. This grammar school allowed me to explore my curiosities in a way that set a standard for my self and the environments I want to be in. At that time, the school awarded one graduating student each year the American Legion School Award Medal for displays of courage, honor, leadership, patriotism, scholarship and service. In my graduating year, I was that student.</p>
<p>I lost that in high school but my exploration continued now fully engulfed in the internet. I lived across forums but my base station was Boxden. I was drawn there by music, in search of the latest Kanye productions or the newest DJ Smallz collaborations. During my time there, I started to develop my software adeptness by creating digital art. I moved around forums a lot. I learned that this was a great way to explore new interest and hobbies. It was also my favorite way to learn since I could get it from people deeply invested in these topics.</p>
<p>I wasnâ€™t performing in school, I was too distracted and it was not engaging for me. Before I could fail out and</p>
<p>To Be Continued... I lost some of what I wrote so I'll have to revisit this.</p>
