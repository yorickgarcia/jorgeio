&lt;p&gt;What if posts could be edited!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first posted this, admittedly it was just a few minutes ago, I was in the middle of writing a longer post. To refresh and escape the tunnel vision trip, I wanted to do a quick image post. What I noticed right away was that the IFTTT widget I was using did a poor job. I didn‚Äôt add the image and it doesn‚Äôt really appear as a blog post of sorts. As such, I will be in search of a better solution, maybe I build one using python‚Ä¶? I saw a guide somewhere that I‚Äôll have to dig up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I face the challenge of deciding what to share. When in situations like this, I reflect back on the people that I‚Äôve met or have observed. Austin Kleon has been on my mind lately, specifically two ideas he shared at the Scratch Conference. Those are, ‚ÄúCreativity is Subtraction‚Äù and just now, &lt;a href="https://austinkleon.com/2015/03/04/the-so-what-test/"&gt;The So What? Test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="So What? Test" src="https://jorgegarcia.io/images/so_what_test.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have so many drafts here. Recently, I pushed a few out from years ago. For what ever reason I kept them there. Perhaps that will be my approach. So here‚Äôs an image post, with as short of a write up as you can expect at this hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one get published right away.- (circa 07/21/19 2am)&lt;/p&gt;

This led to six most satisfying years of my working life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 3rd, 2019, I decided to step down from the Maker Lab. The decision was over differences in what the job was monetarily worth, city bureaucracy brought in new brand new staff who were paid 39.5% more and immediately given more hours and benefits. I did not think this was fair and there was no easy solution to address this so I decided the best thing to do for the moment was to walk away and help in my own way. I still enjoy coming down there as often as I can make it. The team is amazing, please stop on by if you haven‚Äôt been there. I am sure you will enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the new bot, I made new friends and connections that will propel my purpose in using Scratch for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Getting there&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no way I was falling asleep the night before, I usually don't sleep early so how could I before a trip. Not trusting in myself to wake up in time, I took an Uber to the airport around midnight and attempted to sleep in the lobby. My flight was for 6am I was painfully able to nod off for two hours before I woke up freezing. Waking up, I passed by a Starbucks shop that was set to open in 20 minutes but they informed me of another one straight ahead that was 24 hours. What they didn't mention is that the queue was extremely long since it was the only one open in the airport. I happily walked back and waited for the next 15 minutes until they were ready and picked up a coffee and a blueberry scone. The flight was smooth thanks to the first-class voucher that was used, thank you CPL Foundation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arrival, I opted out of ride-share services and took a shuttle to Red Line at the South Station. Thankfully the hotel allowed me to check in early and I was able to get some rest. I had a goal in mind for the day, There was an opening ceremony at 6pm and I wanted to squeeze in a bike ride before that. I remained glued to the bed and napped for a bit. I woke up, showered and purchased a Blue Bike pass. Last time I was here it was Hubway and the rides were limited to 30 minute check-ins like at home and there was a $200 credit hold. This time it was much easier and the 2 hour check-in was just what I needed. I hoped up rode to the dock furthest west and rode on. I could feel how tired I was, I can usually ride these heavy bikes for hours at a time at home but I was peddling much slower this time. Still I had a wonderful ride down the¬† Minuteman Bikeway where I came across heavy rain. I continued on for a while and began my retreat at Maple Street. Even though I didn't reach my goal of getting to downtown Lexington, I was happy to have gotten that far. I took a slightly alternative route and came across a basketball court where I¬† collected my wet self, tossed a couple shots, hydrated and finally ate that scone. I continued on back and prepped for the reception.¬† Here I met Bambi Brewer from Birdbrain Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;micro:bit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, what a little thing the micro:bit is. I first heard of it the during the opening ceremony where Bambi Brewer showed me the Hummingbird Robot with microbit attachment. She also tipped me off that it would be a staple piece in future products from them. Being a big fan, I went up to the ticket counter to exchange the workshop ticket I had originally selected. It popped up again during the opening keynote in a demonstration about how it will integrate with Scratch 3.0. I found myself at a good table and I teamed up with Maureen Tumenas, she had a Chromebook with her and at the beta extension for our microbit did not support her machine. We chugged along and had a selection of projects to work on. We could make an activity tracker, a math story (not sure what that meant), a touch sensor, or we could do the lego challenge and build something with Legos that incorporated the micro:bit. We combined the projects and built a Lego activity tracker with touch sensors. It was a pleasant experience and the outcome was really satisfying. We were able to count¬† jumps and used the pins to add additional input methods to it. I was really happy with it and Maureen Tumenas was fun to team up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I took most from this workshop was inspiration. During the event Maureen informed me that Microcenter was selling this at $10 but they usually retail for $15. While I have two Microcenters in close proximity back home , it didn't stop me from taking a trip to Microcenter during my time in the Boston area. I have been hooked on the little bugger since. In the first month since picking it up, there was but one day that I was not using it. I hope to incorperated the micro:bit into my work with the Library soon with Adults and Teens alike. Recently I have been designing a mixed materials enclosure for it similar to the enclosure I made for the Raspberry Pi Zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Hummingbird&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worked with hummingbirds in the past. I made a special request for them after being awarded a grant in YM. We wanted to make battle-bots out of these guys and we are not far from doing so! I didn't snag a ticket in time but Brandy had one and I am really grateful she gave me one during the opening ceremony. I went in to take any bit of information back, we used them lightly and some of the teens in the space struggled with them and it led us to doing workshop starting with the basic physics of circuits. It was a healthy deviation. During this workshop I made a wonderful friend in Vicky Luk, a primary school teacher from overseas. Later, I learned a lot about the policies and the school culture in her hometown. She comes from a background as an English Major but has found a new mainstay in Computer Science. We were tasked here with re creating a scene from where the wild things are. We use a servo and some LED's to close of the story. My reading cadence didn't match up, whoops. See &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBlN-Dt-m1g"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Day 2 Keynote- Creativity is Subtraction&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[redacted]&lt;/strong&gt; It &lt;strong&gt;[redacted]&lt;/strong&gt; was &lt;strong&gt;[redacted]&lt;/strong&gt; great &lt;strong&gt;[redacted]&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;[redacted]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tossed in the 1060 from my other rig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a Reference Vega 64 that I tried to fit it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That built is currently offline but it added to the mining mix that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up is a Strix Vega 56 for my main machine. I would end up returning and exchanging it for the following picture‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nitro Vega 64. I also got a new case since the HAF XB was no longer fulfilling my needs and this PC wasn‚Äôt in the living room anymore, that was the ITX build. I mined all of 2018-19 winter with that Vega among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my Dell Precision T5500 Dual X5675 with 144GB of RAM.

I am glad to be back in one building and looking forward to the programming that I will be doing with both departments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have added some content on my Projects page. It includes several but not all Finch documentation that I have created. I am often asked to share resources with teachers and other people I come across when discussing the Finch. That usually involves me sending an email and attaching these files. I have decided to post these files online so they can be accessed even when I forget to send an email. I have uploaded them to Google Drive and collected the links here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also adding my computer builds to my Projects page. I thought of this after putting some upgrades into my PC. I really like what AMD is doing and the Ryzen 7 1700 now powers my main build and I absolutely love it. I now have no Intel desktop builds which makes me a bit sad but the Ryzen build has taken over my two previous ones. I also have a new laptop after my Y510p started failing on the GPU side of things. I really put that computer through its paces and it served me very well. Since the beginning of the year, I have sold my 2600K, gave away my 4700MQ, and set my FX-8320 aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Spring will be exciting for me as I grow into the position I have taken. I already know most of the teens that I am working with since I used to be at this YOUmedia. The difference is now I can provide the help and do the activities they wanted me to take part in. The Maker Lab also continues to grow as we incorporate Fusion 360. Workshops with Fusion will begin soon and I know it will empower the staff and our patrons.&lt;/p&gt;

I will be departing my Page position by the end of January 2017 and returning to more grant funded work with CPL. As of February 2017, I will be the Maker Specialist II in CPL's Maker Lab and a YOUmedia Specialist at Harold Washington Library Center. I would rather not use my personal email for work so here I am with a new email address. I look forward to returning as a city staff member with CPL but first I must finish up my education.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="worklife"></category><category term="website"></category></entry></feed>
